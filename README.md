All Codes that contributes to the extension are in extension.ts and package.json, all other files are in the original state generated by yeoman and vscode development extension<br>

The only packages used are the standard vscode library and the superagent package used for making API calls<br>

---------------------------------------

Before deploying the extension:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;replace the icon (line 5 in package.json with "icon": "media/spiraplan-icon-128x128.png")<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;replace the icon on sidebar (line 52 in package.json with "icon": "media/spiraplan-monochrome.svg")<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;replace all "Demo" in command names and Displays with "Spira" - lines: 36,40,44,51,66 in package.json<br>

---------------------------------------
TODOS: <br>
--- Add automatic refresh in the extension.ts file: take in information from user configuration and call retrieveProjects and retrieveInfo every x amount of time, possible code to be used: original extension.ts file lines 10-12<br>

--- Add customizable display in the extension.ts file (disable headers in TreeDataProvider class (lines 200-202 and 236-238 in extension.ts)<br>

--- Add window popup (webview) when a user clicks on an Artifact in the side bar: code in line 173 - 181 in extension.ts should provide all needed information; possible code to be used: original extension.ts file line 68 - 72 (should only need to change variable names)<br>

---------------------------------------
